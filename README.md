# Green Commerce with Amazon

## PROJECT OVERVIEW: 

Our project integrates a web-based e-commerce platform with Amazon, with a focus on sustainability and environmentally friendly products. This project aims to integrate a separate section for green products, a badge rating system to showcase the product's environmental impact, and a box return system to encourage recycling and reduce waste.

## Key Objectives
- Green Product Section: Provide a dedicated section for green and eco-friendly products, allowing users to browse and shop for sustainable items easily.
- Badge Rating System: Implement a badge system that rates products based on their eco-friendliness. These badges should help customers identify environmentally responsible products.
- Box Return System:  Promote sustainability by encouraging users to return packaging boxes for reuse or recycling. This reduces waste and supports a more eco-conscious supply chain.

## Features

- Separate platform for eco-friendly products
- Badge system and third party verification
- Transparency in product manufacturing parameters
- Packaging box return system
- User dashboard and Gift coupons
- Educational section
- Feeback and Notifications system

    - Seller: In this section Amazon sellers can enlist their products in the Greenovation Zone after providing details about the manufacturing of their products.<br>
    - Educational Section: This section aims to inform and educate customers about our ZERO WASTE INITIATIVE. <br>
    - Sustainability Reports: Consists of Amazon's annual sustainability reports and the initiatives that it takes to reduce its carbon footprint. <br><br>
- When a greenovation product is added to the cart it is accomapnied by an "Eco-Friendly" sign.
- After the product is received, two new buttons, "Feedback" and "Return the box", are also available on the website.
    - Feedback: This allows the customers to give their reviews or report products that are incorrectly labeled.
    - Return the box: After enough number of customers click this buttton, and a pre-decided threshold of that area is reached, the customer is notified with the date and time of pick-up.<br>

- When the boxes are collected, the customer is awarded with green bits, which can later be used for redeeming coupons and offers. Customers can keep track of     their green bits and other sustainability statistics with the help of this dashboard.<br>
