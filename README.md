# Green Commerce with Amazon

## PROJECT OVERVIEW: 

Our project integrates a web-based e-commerce platform with Amazon, with a focus on sustainability and environmentally friendly products. This project aims to integrate a separate section for green products, a badge rating system to showcase the product's environmental impact, and a box return system to encourage recycling and reduce waste.
## Key Objectives
- Green Product Section: Provide a dedicated section for green and eco-friendly products, allowing users to browse and shop for sustainable items easily.
- Badge Rating System: Implement a badge system that rates products based on their eco-friendliness. These badges should help customers identify environmentally responsible products.
- Box Return System:  Promote sustainability by encouraging users to return packaging boxes for reuse or recycling. This reduces waste and supports a more eco-conscious supply chain.

## Features
